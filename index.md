## Welcome to Inokufu Schema

This website describes the vocabulary used by Inokufu's applications.
When available we try to follow common standards or vocabulary used in web or education, such as:
- xAPI
- schema.org
- LHEO

However, sometimes some concept are missing or have a slightly different meaning in the context of our applications. As a result, we needed a way to give more details about these concepts and also links them to similar existing concepts when possible.

Interoperability is key to our values and we strongly believe in the power of linked data. We are thus aiming to be compatible with JSON-LD.
